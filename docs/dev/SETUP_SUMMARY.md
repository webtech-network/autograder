# 🎯 Development Environment Setup - Summary

## What We Just Created

I've set up a complete development environment for your autograder project. Here's what each file does:

---

## 📁 New Files Created

### 1. **requirements-dev.txt**
**Location**: Root directory
**Purpose**: All development-only dependencies

**Includes**:
- Testing tools (pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-mock)
- Code formatters (black, isort)
- Linters (flake8, pylint, mypy)
- Documentation tools (sphinx)
- Debugging tools (ipython, ipdb)
- Security scanners (bandit, safety)

**When to use**: Only in development branch

---

### 2. **.pre-commit-config.yaml**
**Location**: Root directory
**Purpose**: Automatically format and check code before every commit

**What it does**:
- Runs Black to format code
- Sorts imports with isort
- Checks code with flake8
- Runs type checker (mypy)
- Scans for security issues (bandit)
- Validates JSON/YAML files

**Setup**: Run `pre-commit install` once

---

### 3. **pyproject.toml**
**Location**: Root directory
**Purpose**: Modern Python project configuration (replaces setup.py)

**Contains**:
- Package metadata (name, version, description)
- Dependencies list
- Build system config
- Tool configurations (black, isort, pytest, coverage, mypy)
- Entry points for CLI commands

**Benefit**: Can publish to PyPI with `pip install autograder`

---

### 4. **Makefile**
**Location**: Root directory
**Purpose**: Simple commands for common tasks

**Usage**:
```bash
make install-dev    # Install everything
make test           # Run tests
make format         # Auto-format code
make lint           # Check code quality
make all            # Run all checks
make run-api        # Start API server
make docs           # Build documentation
```

**Benefit**: No need to remember complex commands

---

### 5. **.devcontainer/**
**Location**: `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` and `Dockerfile.dev`
**Purpose**: VSCode DevContainer for instant development environment

**What it does**:
- Creates consistent environment for all contributors
- Auto-installs all dependencies
- Configures VSCode settings
- Installs recommended extensions

**Usage**: Open in VSCode → "Reopen in Container" → Everything ready!

---

### 6. **.vscode/settings.json**
**Location**: `.vscode/settings.json`
**Purpose**: VSCode IDE configuration

**Configures**:
- Python interpreter path
- Auto-formatting on save
- Linting settings
- Testing configuration
- File exclusions

---

### 7. **DEV_SETUP.md**
**Location**: Root directory
**Purpose**: Complete guide for setting up development environment

**Covers**:
- Installation steps
- Running tests
- Code style guide
- Debugging tips
- Common issues
- Release process

---

### 8. **DEVELOPMENT.md**
**Location**: Root directory
**Purpose**: Explains the development branch strategy

**Explains**:
- Difference between main and development branches
- Workflow for contributions
- What tools are included
- How to merge to production

---

## 🔄 Branch Strategy Explained

### Main Branch (Production)
```
main/
├── requirements.txt          ✅ (Production deps only)
├── README.md                 ✅ (User-focused)
├── Dockerfile                ✅ (Optimized for prod)
├── autograder/              ✅ (Source code)
├── connectors/              ✅ (Source code)
├── docs/                    ✅ (Documentation)
├── tests/                   ✅ (Tests)
└── .github/workflows/       ✅ (CI/CD for releases)
```

**Characteristics**:
- ✅ Stable, tested code only
- ✅ Semantic versioning (v0.1.0, v1.0.0)
- ✅ Tagged releases
- ✅ Published to PyPI
- ✅ Protected (requires PR reviews)
- ❌ No development tools
- ❌ No experimental features

---

### Development Branch (Active Development)
```
development/
├── requirements.txt          ✅ (Production deps)
├── requirements-dev.txt      ✅ (Dev deps)
├── pyproject.toml           ✅ (Modern packaging)
├── .pre-commit-config.yaml  ✅ (Code quality)
├── Makefile                 ✅ (Dev commands)
├── .devcontainer/           ✅ (VSCode container)
├── .vscode/                 ✅ (IDE config)
├── DEV_SETUP.md             ✅ (Setup guide)
├── DEVELOPMENT.md           ✅ (Branch guide)
├── LICENSE                  ✅ (MIT license)
├── CONTRIBUTING.md          ✅ (Contribution guide)
└── [all main branch files]  ✅
```

**Characteristics**:
- ✅ Latest features (may be unstable)
- ✅ All development tools
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks enforced
- ✅ Detailed error messages
- ✅ Auto-reload for API development
- ✅ Debug logging enabled
- ✅ Integration tests run here first

## 🚀 How to Use

### For New Contributors

1. **Clone and setup**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/autograder.git
   cd autograder
   git checkout development
   make dev-setup  # Installs everything + pre-commit hooks
   ```

2. **Create feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```

3. **Develop with confidence**
   ```bash
   # Make changes to code
   
   # Test as you go
   make test
   
   # Format automatically
   make format
   
   # Run all checks
   make all
   ```

4. **Commit (pre-commit hooks run automatically)**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(templates): add Python template"
   # Pre-commit hooks run here ↑
   ```

5. **Push and create PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-new-feature
   # Create PR to development branch on GitHub
   ```

---

### For Maintainers

**Merging feature to development**:
```bash
# Review PR
# If approved, merge feature → development
# CI/CD runs automatically
```

**Merging development to main (release)**:
```bash
# 1. Ensure all tests pass in development
git checkout development
make all  # Everything must pass

# 2. Update version and changelog
bump2version minor  # or patch, major
# Edit CHANGELOG.md

# 3. Create PR: development → main
# 4. After merge, tag release
git checkout main
git tag v0.2.0
git push origin v0.2.0

# 5. Publish to PyPI (CI/CD can automate this)
make build
make publish
```

---

## 🎨 Code Quality Workflow

### Automatic (Pre-commit)
Every time you commit:
1. ✅ Black formats your code
2. ✅ isort organizes imports
3. ✅ flake8 checks for issues
4. ✅ mypy checks types
5. ✅ bandit scans security
6. ✅ Files are validated

If any fail → commit is blocked → fix issues → try again

### Manual (Before PR)
```bash
# Run everything manually
make all

# This runs:
# - make format     (auto-fixes)
# - make lint       (checks code)
# - make type-check (checks types)
# - make test       (runs tests)
```
