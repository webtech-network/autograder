general:

    # POOL SIZE: Minimum number of idle sandboxes to maintain for each language
    # - This is the baseline number always kept ready
    # - System will automatically create more on-demand up to scale_limit
    # Development: 2-3, Production: 3-5 depending on expected baseline load
    pool_size: 3

    # SCALE LIMIT: Maximum total sandboxes (active + idle) per language
    # - System scales UP automatically when all sandboxes are busy
    # - System scales DOWN automatically when demand decreases
    # - This is your safety limit to prevent resource exhaustion
    # Production recommendations:
    #   - Light load (< 10 concurrent users): 10
    #   - Medium load (10-50 concurrent users): 20-30
    #   - Heavy load (50+ concurrent users): 50+
    # Note: Each sandbox uses ~128MB RAM + 0.5 CPU
    scale_limit: 10

    # IDLE TIMEOUT: Seconds before destroying idle sandboxes above pool_size
    # - Sandboxes are destroyed only if: total > pool_size AND idle > idle_timeout
    # - This prevents keeping too many idle resources during low traffic
    # Development: 300 (5 min), Production: 600 (10 min) to reduce churn
    idle_timeout: 600

    # RUNNING TIMEOUT: Maximum seconds a sandbox can be actively processing
    # - Prevents hanging/stuck processes from blocking resources
    # - Active sandboxes exceeding this are forcefully destroyed
    # - Should be generous enough for complex submissions
    # Development: 60, Production: 120 (2 min) for safety
    running_timeout: 120

# SCALING BEHAVIOR (After Fix):
# 1. ON HIGH DEMAND: When all idle sandboxes are busy, system automatically
#    creates new sandboxes up to scale_limit
# 2. ON LOW DEMAND: When sandboxes become idle and exceed pool_size + idle_timeout,
#    they are destroyed to free resources
# 3. MINIMUM MAINTAINED: Always maintains pool_size idle sandboxes ready
# 4. MAXIMUM ENFORCED: Never exceeds scale_limit total sandboxes
