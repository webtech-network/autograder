Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the global economy and the modern workplace. While AI augments human capabilities and automates repetitive tasks, it also raises questions about job displacement, fairness, and the need for upskilling. To navigate this transition responsibly, educators and organizations must emphasize critical thinking, ethical use of AI, and collaboration between humans and intelligent systems. With thoughtful policy and training, AI can become a multiplier for productivity and creativity rather than a replacement for human potential.
